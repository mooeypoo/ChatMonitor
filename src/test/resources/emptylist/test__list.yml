 # If there was a word match, this potion dictates whether the message that triggered
 # the match is allowed to be sent to the chat. If the option is false, the message that
 # contained a matched word will be muted and not appear in chat, and, if it was used in a
 # command, the command will be blocked. If set to false, the group response (and runcommands
 # will still occur, but the message itself (or command) will be allowed to pass through to the
 # chat, or the command allowed to continue and be processed.
